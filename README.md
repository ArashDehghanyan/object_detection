# object_detection<br>
This project implemented the yolo v2 object detector using python and tensorflow from scratch.<br>
You can download the package and run the main.ipynb cell by cell. <br>The Darknet-19 model with 24 layers was employed to detect objects and their positions in the images.<br><br>The source code is taken from [maskara vivek blog](https://www.maskaravivek.com/post/yolov2/) with a little bit change. For example dummy vectors was ignored 
because really there is no need of them.
